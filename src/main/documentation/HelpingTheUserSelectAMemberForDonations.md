# Default Selected Member

We want to help the user by pre-selecting a member/student when they make a 
new donation. The initial strategy will to pre-select the last student that
they entered. 


# Making it Easier to Select Previously Selected Students

We also want to help them when they have multiple students they
make donations for, so we will sort the member list with students they have
previously donated for at the top of the list. If we don't use a list, we will 
still make sure to do something to pull previously entered members to the
top or a prominent position.
